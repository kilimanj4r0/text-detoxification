* Instead of using vulgar language or slang, use more respectful or formal language. For example, instead of saying fucking lawyer, you could say a lawyer.
* When making references to a person or group, avoid using derogatory or offensive terms. For example, instead of referring to people as niggers, you could use a more appropriate term like people or individuals.
* Avoid making violent or threatening statements. Instead of saying kill before dying, you could say protect oneself.
* Avoid using discriminatory language based on someone's race, religion, nationality, or other protected characteristics. For example, instead of using the N-word to refer to someone, you could use a more neutral term like an assistant or a colleague.
* When making references to individuals or groups, avoid using extreme or exaggerated language that might be considered offensive. For example, instead of saying Evil down to their black hearts, you could say has some questionable tendencies.
* Avoid making assumptions about someone's intentions or actions based on limited information. Instead of assuming that someone wants to kill themselves, you could ask for more information or clarification before making any conclusions.

However, I can provide suggestions on how you might approach this task. One possibility is to use a combination of natural language processing techniques, such as sentiment analysis and part-of-speech tagging, to identify potentially toxic words and phrases in the text and replace them with more neutral alternatives. For example, instead of you sound like a fucking lawyer, man, you might say I don't need any proof. Man, you sound like a lawyer.
